# Unexpected Empty Array Return in MATLAB Function

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in MATLAB: returning an empty array [] when a scalar value (e.g., 0) is expected. This can lead to unexpected behavior in downstream calculations and comparisons.

## The Bug
The `myFunction.m` file contains a function that, under certain conditions, returns an empty array. This causes issues when this function is used in contexts where a scalar value is anticipated.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version of the function that returns a scalar (0) instead of an empty array when appropriate. This solution ensures consistent behavior and avoids unexpected errors.

## How to Reproduce
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open `bug.m` and `bugSolution.m` in MATLAB.
3.  Run the test cases at the bottom of each file to see the different behaviors.

## Lessons Learned
- Carefully consider the expected output type of your functions.
- Avoid returning empty arrays when a scalar value is expected, unless you explicitly handle this case.
- Always test your functions thoroughly, especially with edge cases and unexpected inputs.
